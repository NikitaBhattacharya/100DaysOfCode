Given a integer n. We have n*n values of a 2-d array, and n values of 1-d array. Task is to find the sum of the left diagonal values of the 2-d array and the max element of the 1-d array and print them with space in between. Input : arr[][] = {{1,2,3}, {4,5,6}, {7, 8,9}} and N = 3 brr[] = {3, 6, 9} Output : 15 9 Explanation: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 So, this sum of left diagonal (1+ 5 + 9) = 15 The maximum element in an array brr is 9 So, will return {15, 9} as an answer.
